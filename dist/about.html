              <h1>The Origins</h1>
              <p>Lisa Marie Crafts was founded by Lisa Marie Christine Woodbridge, who developed an interest in handmade crafts from a very young age. She's always had a creative flair and began to draw and paint as soon as she was able to hold a pencil. Aged 11, her passion and creativity flourished into a love for crafts as she started to make cards, a journey kick-started by her parents and a friend of her Mum’s.
                 Lisa explains that her Mum was her biggest inspiration into crafting: "My Mum was very supportive in my creativity, buying me felt-tip pens and painting-by-numbers sets. She was very creative herself and always making something, so I guess that's where I get my ability from. Although she had more of a passion for material crafts such as knitting, making clothes, and curtains."</p>
              <p>She goes on to point out that her Mum's friend also helped to put her on this journey, as Lisa always enjoyed receiving the handmade crafts she made, which included techniques such as stamping and embossing. Noticing her interest, Lisa's Mum suggested that she should also try her hand at making her own cards. From there, Lisa’s parents bought her a handmade card starter pack and, as a returning gift, Lisa made them her very first 'Thank You' card, which became one of many cards to come in the future.
                 From handmade cards, Lisa’s passion for crafts expanded. She began sewing and developing different craft techniques. In later years, Lisa’s Mum taught her how to knit, and she learnt how to crochet through self-teaching. Lisa loves to constantly learn and develop new crafting methods, giving everything a try from pyrography to enamelling. For Lisa: "Learning a new craft ignites a passion and it's become a type of therapy for me."</p>
